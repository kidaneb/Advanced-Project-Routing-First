# Advanced React Routing Project

This project showcases advanced functionalities in React routing, including:
  * Filtering data by query from the URL: Utilize search parameters to dynamically refine displayed data according to user-defined criteria.
  * Mutation of data: Handle new post creation and existing data editing through intuitive forms and API interactions.
  * Leveraging action and loader features: Implement React Router's action and loader features for streamlined data fetching and navigation.
Key Features:
  * Filterable Data: Users can dynamically filter data based on parameters added to the URL, providing a flexible and intuitive search experience.
  * Post Creation and Editing: Create new data entries and edit existing ones through user-friendly forms, seamlessly interacting with the backend API.
  * Reactive UI Updates: The UI reacts instantly to changes in the URL and form submissions, offering a responsive and real-time feel.
  * Data Fetching with Loaders: Loaders efficiently pre-fetch data before rendering the corresponding component, optimizing performance and minimizing loading times.
  * Navigation with Actions: Actions handle form submissions and navigation, guiding users through the application while managing data updates.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
